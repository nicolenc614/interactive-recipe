  <h2> Halwa Poori </h2>

  <h4> What is Halwa Poori?</h4>
    <p class=info>
  Halwa poori is a traditional Pakistani breakfast that features semolina pudding or halwa and a soft fried dough called poori. Halwa is typically made with a mixture of fried semolina and sugar syrup, which is then combined with nuts such as pistachios and almonds. The sweet dish is flavored with aromatics like green cardamom pods, kewra essence, and cloves, and it is usually enhanced with yellow or orange food coloring for a more vibrant dish.
  Poori is a soft and fluffy fried bread consisting of a dough made with flour, water, salt, and oil. It is shaped into a thin, flat disk, and then usually deep-fried until it puffs up. Fresh and hot poori is traditionally accompanied by sweet semolina halwa.

<h3>How to cook Halwa Poori </h3>
<h4 class="title"> Ingredients</h4>
<p>

<i>Halwa:</i>
<br>
1 cup semolina
<br>
1 cup sugar
<br>
1 cup ghee or butter (you can opt to use up to half this amount)
<br>
1 can or 2 cups evaporated milk (you can use whole milk instead)
<br>
&frac14 tsp. cardamom powder
<br>
pinch of colour and/or saffron (optional)
<br>
crushed or flaked nuts for garnishing
<br>
<br>
<i>Poori:</i>

<br>
1 &frac12 cups all-purpose flour
<br>
&frac12 cup atta flour
<br>
2 tbsp. yogurt
<br>
3 tbsp. oil
<br>
1 tsp. salt
<br>
pinch of baking powder
<br>
warm water for kneading (you can add a bit of milk in it for extra soft pooris)
oil for deep frying
</div>
</p>
<h4 class="title"> Instructions </h4>
<p>
<i>For the Halwa:</i>
<p class="info">
1. Heat ghee/butter in a pan, add the semolina and fry on low heat until colour starts to change and it gives a lovely nutty aroma.
<br>
2. You should keep stirring often so the colour is even. In the meantime, pour the milk and sugar, saffron and/or food color into a blender and blend until well combined.
<br>
3. Once the semolina is golden, slowly add the blended milk/sugar mixture a little at a time. Be careful not to pour it all at once because it will splutter.
<br>
4. Once all the milk is in the semolina, keep stirring and let it cook until most of the moisture is gone.
<br>
5. Add the cardamom powder, mix it in, then cover and set on low heat to steam for 5 minutes.
<br>
6. Garnish with nuts before serving.</p>
<br>
<br>
</p>


<p id="poori">For the Pooris:</p>
<p class="info">
1. Sift the flour, add the baking powder, salt, yoghurt and oil. Gradually add in the warm water and knead to a soft dough.
<br>
2. Let it sit for about 20mins, then divide the dough into 10-12 pieces.
<br>
3. Roll each one out to about 4 inches diameter.
<br>
4. Heat your oil, make sure it's quite hot. Put in a poori in the hot oil and immediately start splashing hot oil over the top of it with a spoon. Gently press down on the poori with the back of a wooden spoon or spatula, and you will see it start to puff up.
<br>
5. If the poori turns dark in less than a minute, the oil is too hot.
<br>
6. Reduce the heat of the stove.
<br>
7. Gently press down with the spatula, and wait till it puffs completely, it should take only a few seconds.
<br>
8. Flip the poori over and cook the other side until golden brown.
<br>
9. Drain on paper towels and serve while hot.

  <h2>Anda Paratha </h2>
  <h4> What is Anda Paratha? </h4>
  <p class="info">
  Golden-brown in color, flaky and layered, paratha is a type of Indian bread that is typically consumed for breakfast. The name comes from a combination of words parat and atta (flour), referring to the cooked, layered dough. It consists of whole wheat flour that is baked in ghee and comes in round, triangular, square, or heptagonal shapes. Parathas are often accompanied/stuffed with eggs.

      <h3>How to cook Anda Paratha </h3>
      <h4 class="title"> Ingredients</h4>
      <p>
    
      <i>Omelette:</i>
        <br>
  3 Eggs
    <br>
&frac14 Cup onion, finely chopped
    <br>
  1 Tbsp coriander leaves, chopped
    <br>
  2 Green chilies, finely chopped
    <br>
  Salt as required
    <br>
    <br>
  <i>Dough:</i>
    <br>
  1 Cup whole wheat flour
    <br>
  &frac12 Tsp salt
    <br>
&frac12 Tsp carom seeds/ ajwain (optional)
    <br>
  1 Tsp oil/ ghee
    <br>
  Water for kneading the dough
    <br>
  Oil for cooking the paratha
    <br>
</p>
  <h4 class="title"> Instructions</h4>
<p class="info">
1. In a mixing bowl, add flour, salt and oil, and knead the mixture into a smooth dough using 1 cup of water. You can add in a little more water if the dough seems dry.
  <br>
2. Knead well.
  <br>
3. Divide the dough into 4 balls. Roll out the dough ball evenly using a rolling pin, then fold it twice to form a triangle.
  <br>
4. Roll it out again to make a triangular sheet.
  <br>
5. Repeat the process with the remaining dough. In a bowl, whisk the eggs well along with onions, chilli, coriander leaves, garam masala and salt. Keep aside.
  <br>
6. Place the rolled dough on a hot tawa, and let it cook for 1-2 minutes on both sides. Add a little oil on the surface and let it cook for one more minute.
  <br>
7. As the edges start to crisp, quickly make a slit using a sharp knife along the folds and pour in half the quantity of egg. Tilt the paratha a little so that the egg mix slides in. Then flip it over and repeat the process on the other side.
  <br>
8. Drizzle some more oil on the paratha and press the surface gently using the back of your spoon. Turn up the heat and continue cooking the paratha until it fluffs up and turns crisp brown.
  <br>
9. Serve hot with a helping of desi ghee on top.
