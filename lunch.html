  <h2> Bandeja Paisa </h2>


  <h4> What is Bandeja Paisa? </h4>
  <p class="info">
    Bandeja paisa is a typical dish served in Colombia's Antioquia region, and was the perfect meal for peasants or workers who needed a protein-packed dish while
    working all day, climbing up the vast, mountainous terrain, and working on the farms. But this combination of protein and carbohydrates is still popular today. Bandeja Paisa includes: red beans cooked with pork, white rice, carne molida (ground meat), chicharron, fried egg, plantain (platano maduro), chorizo, arepa, hogao sauce, black pudding (morcilla), avocado and lemon.

  <h2>Pupusas </h2>
  <h4> What is Pupusas?</h4>
  <p class="info">
  In El Salvador, the Pupusa is so wildly popular that it was officially named the national dish in 2005. Its history goes back centuries, to the indigenous Pipil people. Pupusas are thick corn cakes filled with a variety of ingredients such as pork, chicken, cheese or beans. For certain, they are always served with curtido, a wonderfully crunchy and tangy cabbage slaw, and a simple red salsa.

      <h3>How to cook Pupusas</h3>
      <h4> Ingredients</h4>
    
      <p>
  <i>Filling Options:</i>
<br>
      Braised meats
      <br>
      Pork shoulder
      <br>
      Beef
      <br>
      Chicken
      <br>
      Veggies
    <br>
    Pureed Beans
      <br>
    Cheese
      <br>

 <br>

  <i>For the Pupusas:</i>
  <br><br>
4 cups masa harina ,white or yellow 3 &frac12 - 4 cups warm water
<br>
&frac12 teaspoon salt
<br>
2 Tablespoons butter ,softened (optional)
<br>
1 teaspoon chicken bouillon
<br>

</p>
  <h4> Instructions</h4>
<p class="info">
  1. Add masa harina (corn flour) and salt to a large mixing bowl.
  <br>
  2. Add the warm water, little by little, mixing the dough with your hand. You may not
  need all of the water. You want the masa to be the consistency of a soft play dough. If the dough is too wet, mix in some more masa harina. If its too dry, add a little more water.
<br>
  3. Scoop the dough into large, golf-ball-size portions. You can scoop all of the dough into balls before continuing, or make 1 pupusa at a time. Be sure to keep the dough covered with a damp cloth as you work, to keep it from drying out.
<br>
  4. Use the palms of your hands to pat the dough into a disc, about 4 inches in diameter.
<br>
  5. Scoop about half a tablespoon of the beans and place it in the center of the dough circle, followed by a pinch of shredded cheese.
<br>
  6. Gently bring the edges of the dough up and around the filling, pinching it closed into a ball. Gently pat the dough between your palms to form it into a disc again.
<br>
  7. Heat a large ungreased skillet or pan over medium heat. Place pupusas on the hot pan and cook for about 2-4 minutes on each side. You will know the pupusas are ready to flip when the edges are set and the bottom is lightly golden.
<br>
  8. Serve immediately, topped with Curtido and Salsa Roja.
